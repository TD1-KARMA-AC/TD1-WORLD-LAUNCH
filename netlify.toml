# Note: Netlify Functions at /.netlify/functions/* are handled automatically BEFORE redirects
# IMPORTANT: Netlify processes redirects in order - specific rules must come BEFORE catch-all
# Netlify serves static files FIRST, but we need explicit rules to prevent catch-all from intercepting

# IMPORTANT: Netlify serves static files FIRST before processing ANY redirects
# So if a file exists at /website/demos/TD1_INTENT_demo.html, it will be served automatically
# We don't need redirect rules for static files - they are served by default
# The catch-all redirect below will ONLY match if no static file is found

# Handle SPA routing - redirect root and other paths to index.html
# BUT: Netlify serves static files FIRST, so /website/demos/*.html will be served automatically
# The catch-all only matches if no static file exists
# We need to ensure the catch-all doesn't interfere with static file serving

# Catch-all for SPA routing - this will only match if no static file is found
# Static files in /website/demos/ will be served BEFORE this rule is processed
