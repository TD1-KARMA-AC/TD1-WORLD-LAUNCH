# Email Form Status

## Current Setup

The "Be the first to know when we launch" form on the launch page:

✅ **Collects email addresses** - Form works perfectly  
✅ **Saves to Netlify Forms** - View in Netlify Dashboard → Forms  
✅ **Stores in localStorage** - Backup storage  
✅ **Shows success message** - User feedback  

❌ **No email notifications** - Disabled to avoid $20/month Netlify cost

---

## Viewing Submissions

**In Netlify Dashboard:**
- Go to: Site → Forms → "launch-notifications"
- See all email addresses collected
- Export as CSV if needed
- No limit on free tier for viewing/storing

---

## Future: Adding Newsletter

When ready to send emails/newsletters, we can:

1. **Export emails from Netlify** (CSV download)
2. **Use email service:**
   - Mailchimp (free up to 500 contacts)
   - SendGrid (free 100/day)
   - ConvertKit (free up to 1,000 subscribers)
   - Or your own newsletter service

3. **Or integrate newsletter service directly:**
   - Connect form to newsletter API
   - Automatic signup when form is submitted
   - Send newsletters from that service

---

## Cost Comparison

- **Netlify Forms email notifications**: $20/month
- **Newsletter services**: Free or cheaper options available
- **Better ROI**: Use newsletter service when ready

---

## Summary

✅ Form is working and collecting emails  
✅ View submissions in Netlify Dashboard  
❌ No email notifications (saving $20/month)  
📧 Will add newsletter service later when ready
